Pipeman - A Python web ui process executor
=============================================
This tool provides a way to execute several tasks (even rm -rf) using a web ui.
Multiple tasks can be added and executed / restarted, a console output is shown.
This is a very buggy implementation so far, improvements coming soon.

Requirements coming soon to.

Known bugs:
- Not displaying current task status
- Console logging keeps scrolling down all the time
- running proceses trace are lost when another action is invoked or the page refreshed.
